# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project is to analyze a raw dataset containing student test scores from various schools within a school district. The user of the final reports would like to see some key metrics on what affected student testing performance and then to use that information to make decisions on future funding awards within the district.

### Purpose
Explore the Python Pandas library, learning to use the library to read data from a file and create meaningful data visuals for analysis. Specifically learn how to create DataFrames, how to manipulate them to contain useful information, and how to build off of DataFrames to build summary reports containing key metrics.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of PyCitySchools Module Activity
There are a number of useful reports initially created from the guided module activity, including a distict summary table and associated tables to narrow down on specific variables that may have contributed to student success or lack thereof in the district testing.

The initial analysis of the entire dataset revealed the top five performing schools in the district. We are then left to ponder, what exactly separated these schools from the pack? There is a significant amount of data present even in the above <i>summary</i> table. A common assumption might be that the schools with the highst levels of funding result in the greatest student success.

### Analysis of PyCitySchools Challenge

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There is <i>so much to learn</i> with the pandas library! This was a huge module and required a lot of getting into the documentation to understand the syntax of various functions and methods. I definitely feel like I'm on a steep learning curve, but I also feel like the experience is going to make a big difference. Being able to dig into data and build various tables to analyze, visualize, and understand it is an incredible tool.

I think my biggest challenge this week was time management with my professional obligations. But I am proud of my effort and the outcome of the work here. I am excited to continue learning pandas and implement it further in my career.
