### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There is <i>so much to learn</i> with the pandas library! This was a huge module and required a lot of getting into the documentation to understand the syntax of various functions and methods. I definitely feel like I'm on a steep learning curve, but I also feel like the experience is going to make a big difference. Being able to dig into data and build various tables to analyze, visualize, and understand it is an incredible tool.

I think my biggest challenge this week was time management with my professional obligations. But I am proud of my effort and the outcome of the work here. I am excited to continue learning pandas and implement it further in my career.
